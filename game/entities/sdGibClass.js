			Uses defined indices in order to optimize performance AND to keep gun classes compatible across different snapshots.
		
			Will also check for Index problems and tell you if any of changes that are done will cause server to crash eventually (cases like missing indices between few existing indices and index intersection)
		
			Variables prefixed as sdGib.CLASS_* are the indices, here they are assigned during gib class object creation and specify index at sdGib.classes array where bug class object will exist.
		
			You can execute this:
				sdWorld.entity_classes.sdGib.classes
			in devTools console in order to see how it will be stored in the end.
			
			Sure we could insert classes by doing something like sdGib.classes.push({ ... }); but that would not store index of class in array for later quick spawning of new guns.
			We could also do something like sdGib.classes[ sdGib.classes.length ] = { ... }; but that would not give us consistency across different versions of the game and also it seems 
				like sometimes whoever adds new classes seems to be addin them in the middle of the list. Don't do that - add them at the very end.
		
			Once sdGib-s are saved to snapshots only their ID is saved. It means that if IDs will be changed - it is quite possible to convert existing sdGib.CLASS_TRIPLE_RAIL into sdGib.FISTS which isn't event 
				a spawnable gun (only projectile properties are copied from it).
		
			Now press "Ctrl + Shift + -" if you are in NetBeans and go do the impressive!
