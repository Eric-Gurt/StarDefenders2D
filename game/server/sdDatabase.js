/*

	Implementing the most simple database possible - just a serializable JS object

	Not ready.

	This should implement:
	 - Movement from server to server
	 - Ability to start new worlds, automatically assign free expedition_worker servers
	 - Account management
	 - Saving/restoring player items
	 - Letting players respawn with losing only portion of their score on death
	 - Base movement between servers (with steering wheel)
	 - Assist player and help him/her find server where his/her character is
